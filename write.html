      <h2> Zia Rahman </h2>

      <p style="margin-right:30%;">
        What is <em>CONSCIOUSNESS?</em> And does it matter? It is something more than objective/subjective, which
        may limit the seriousness of the issue to the more common contrast made between less meaningful
        disagreements or differences (less meaningful on the grand scale but obviously human experiences are very meaningful
        to the people experiencing them.) such as "being objective" or a "subjective experience." But CONSCIOUSNESS
        (lmao it's capitalizing) itself doesn't seem to be restricted to this dichotemy of objective/subjective, moreso
        the base of all that there is. To be able to differentiate, to distinct, to make comparison relies on one, the ability to
        be able do/think/<b>be</b> something that is capable of distinction. Two, to have something to compare to, as even the lone atom
        and its component parts may be infintessimally divided into more "things" e.g. a quantum string implies a start and end location
        or experience. Though not required, for what it's worth these things need to have an observer, or at least something outside of these
        objects/experiences to make distinctions, or to be able to differentiate itself to some degree as humans are capable of to a
        certain extent.

        <p style="margin-right:30%;">
        This CONSCIOUSNESS, the base of experience could be aligned on a spectrum, or basically the opposite of binary
        thought in terms of capability. Say, do animals have less "CONSCIOUSNESS" than humans? Does the act of merely acting on impulse/instict
        downplay the significance of being able to "act" in the first place? Adding in, from an animal's rights viewpoint so to say, what if these animals experiences are
        so different from ours (beyond a first glance) that we couldn't even know. It could be useless to place their <i>living</i> experience on some axis of CONSCIOUSNESS,
        and it may be something beyond our realm to understand entirely, as much as we want to understand it. Heading down to the simple single celled organisms and the spark of "life," these
        things are brought into motion without any meaning required, they just do. And on that note, in terms of the actual impact that organic or inorganic
        things have on this world, does it really matter that a rock isn't "alive?" That acts of god such as a tornado or hurricane can inflict a multitude of
        effects on the experience of the living things on Earth.

        <p style="margin-right:30%;">
        All this not to downplay humanity, or reduce our experience into some stupid fucking Nihilistic "blue dot in space" attitudes.
        These human experiences matter as they do to humans, and when it is your only conscious experience it turns out it really matters!
        On the other end of the scale (as mankind is almost universally placed on the highest range of this CONSCIOUSNESS spectrum/axis), does it matter
        that a small cell or bug is alive? Magnetism, geological processes, gravity, space/time, etc. could be "alive" in a sense but I feel that also
        limits it as with the "subjective" CONSCIOUSNESS. It may help to think of these processes as being "alive", or something equivocal conceputually/linguistically,
        but I feel that still limits it in scale. As we experience the world, you can extrapolate to all the matter, clumps of gas/rock, planets, stars, solar systems, galaxies,
        clusters, etc. etc. etc. At the end of this you reach the edge of the universe? If the universe is expanding does that imply that there is somewhere/something to expand to?
        And if it is expanding what propels it forward, as things tend to slow down pretty fast here on Earth.
        If these properties/boundaries to the universe have this amount of an impact, they may be more "alive" than us or at least more something. They are the "outside," our "environment" so
        to speak. They are both our limitations as to what is possible, and also at the same time the foundation or creation that can lead us to be able to <i>literally <b>"believe"</b></i> this idea in
        the first place.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-right:30%;">
        With this background/enviroment to take part in, we are created from it's mud/clay => flora => fauna => humans as they are. (Yes a lot of "animal" life came
        before plant life). Well what is that CONSCIOUSNESS anyways? Is it something that is created or experienced? Is it individual or shared
        to some extent as "collective consciousness". Is it a universal <i>constant</i> in and of itself, to be accessed by the vessel of our brain/body, at a particular
        moment in time. That is to say are <i>we</i> our CONSCIOUSNESS, is it a pool to draw from or something in which we<i>contribute/feed</i>. Does this have a
        soul/experience/life to be tethered to, that may be shifted through the conservation of energy/matter into another life/creation (e.g. "past lives") or possibly <thead>
        foundation for new life aka "we're made of stardust bro."
      </p>
      <p style="margin-right:30%;">
        Expanding outwards... Should I even expand outwards? If this CONSCIOUSNESS stems from our brain's hallucination based on our inputs/senses,
        what does this mean for us practically? In a solipsist viewpoint, or at least drawing from it, most of the time we can only verify
        our own existence. Yadda yadda you could break that down even further ala brain in a vat, but from a practical standpoint we think, therefore
        we are. However, we do not even need to look far to see the breakdown of who we are, as in the case of degenerative diseases, brain damage, or other
        conditions that impact our human experience. If somebody is in a vegetative state or a coma, are they <i>alive</i>? Are they a "vegetable" like a plant,
        limited to chemical reactions to outside stimuli, or the bodily processes that sustain human life. If they are hooked up to an artificial breathing/heart/feeding are
        they alive or do a person's caretakers become <i>them</i> in a morbid sense as the caretakers hold the man in the hospital beds' fate for survival physically, and subsequentally <thead>
        mans ability to be CONSCIOUSNESS. Surviving a state like that, having an incident like Phineas Gage, or being afflicted by something like Autism reflects the biology that brings CONSCIOUSNESS
        and emotions to life. This biology stems from the great(in scope but also haha yeah pretty great) Universe/Enviroment, and just as something like the principles of physics may limit us
        on a grand scale this biology limits our individual conscious experience. I mean think of how scary a lobotomy is, and how aside from all this philosophy gobbledy-gook there are very
        real and surprisingly easy ways to poke holes in our basic understanding/consciousness. (All this ignoring GOD)
